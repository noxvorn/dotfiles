# dotfiles (chezmoi)

Dotfiles managed with [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/).

## Requirements

### Target OS

- macOS (primary target; other OSes are untested)

### Required tools

- `chezmoi` installed and available in `PATH`
- `git` (used by `chezmoi init` and repo updates)

### Optional tools

- 1Password CLI (`op`) if you use template secrets (`onepasswordRead`)
  - If `op` is installed on macOS, run `op signin` before `chezmoi apply` (`dot_config/git/config.tmpl` requires `op whoami`)
- `prek` only if you want to run pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`)

## Shell policy

- Use the macOS default `/bin/zsh` as the login shell
- Use Homebrew to provide shell-related tools and plugins such as `starship`, `fzf`, and `mise`
- Do not require Homebrew's `zsh` package for this dotfiles setup
- Initialize `mise` in `~/.zprofile` with `mise activate zsh --shims` so tools installed via `mise` are available from non-interactive shell entry points
- Initialize `mise` again in `~/.zshrc` with `mise activate zsh` because day-to-day work usually runs through interactive shells

## Quick start

Initialize from the repo:

```sh
chezmoi init --apply https://github.com/noxvorn/dotfiles.git
```

If your source state is tracked by chezmoi and you want to pull latest changes:

```sh
chezmoi update
```

If this repo is already your local chezmoi source directory and you updated it manually:

```sh
chezmoi apply
```

Preview changes before applying:

```sh
chezmoi diff
```
